# **Aviation Safety Risk Assessment**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes historical aviation accident data to assess risks associated with different aircraft types, manufacturers, and locations. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support the companyâ€™s decision to enter the aviation industry while minimizing operational risks.

## **Business Understanding**
### **Stakeholder**
The primary stakeholder is the company's aviation division, responsible for acquiring aircraft and determining operational strategies.

### **Key Business Questions**
1. Which aircraft categories have the lowest accident rates?
2. What manufacturers produce the safest aircraft?
3. Which locations pose the highest risk for aviation accidents?
4. What trends can be identified over time regarding aviation safety?

## **Data Understanding and Analysis**
### **Source of Data**
The dataset used in this project comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), covering aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023.

### **Description of Data**
- **Aircraft Information:** Aircraft category, make (manufacturer), and engine type.
- **Accident Information:** Date, location, phase of flight, severity of injuries.
- **Injury Metrics:** Number of fatal, serious, minor injuries, and uninjured passengers.

### **Data Analysis and Visualizations**
#### **1. Distribution of Injury Categories**
This visualization highlights the frequency of fatal, serious, and minor injuries in aviation accidents.

#### **2. Risk Ranking of Aircraft Makes**
This bar chart ranks different aircraft manufacturers by their accident risk scores, indicating the safest and riskiest makes.

#### **3. Top 10 High-Risk Locations for Accidents**
A bar chart showcasing the locations with the highest accident risk, helping stakeholders avoid high-risk operational zones.

## **Conclusion**
### **Summary of Findings**
1. **Certain aircraft categories and manufacturers have significantly lower accident rates**, making them safer options for purchase.
2. **High-risk locations exhibit greater accident frequencies**, often due to environmental factors or operational challenges.
3. **Takeoff and landing are the most dangerous phases of flight**, necessitating enhanced training and safety protocols.

By leveraging these insights, the company can make informed decisions when selecting aircraft and determining operational locations, ultimately enhancing aviation safety and business viability.
